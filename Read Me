We propose a deep learning technique for anomaly detection in video surveillance cameras. The proposed method has been evaluated in the 5 different datasets such as UCF, BOSS, Shanghai, Avenue and Behave. 
We experiment our model on various deep-learning techniques such as c3d, vgg and resnet50. We used neural network based solution for the  problem.
